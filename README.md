The game "Spike Balls" is a 3D multiplayer, player-versus-player (PvP) game where two players compete to stay in the arena. The player who falls off the arena loses the round, and the other player earns a point. The game continues until both players agree to stop. The game's name comes from the characters, which are two spiked balls, adding a unique element to the mechanics. The ball's spikes play a crucial role, allowing players to potentially grab and hold onto the spikes, influencing gameplay and making it more challenging.
Developed in Unity and programmed with C#, the game was created to provide a dynamic gaming experience. The arena is large, offering ample space for movement, and it includes obstacles to increase difficulty. The players' movements are controlled via keyboard inputs, and the ball’s speed increases when keys are held down longer. This mechanic adds an element of skill development and strategy.
